The country\\'s territory comprises one main island, 63\\nsatellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet; the combined area\\nof these has increased by approximately 25% since the country\\'s\\nindependence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It\\nhas the second highest popul ation density of any country in the\\nworld, although there are numerous green and recreational spaces as\\na result of urban planning. With a multicultural popul ation and in\\nrecognition of the cultural identities of the major ethnic groups\\nwithin the nation, Singapore has four official langua ges: English,\\nMalay, Mandarin, and Tamil.

In 1867,  the colonies in Southeast Asia were reorganised,\\nand Singapore came unde r the direct control of Britain as part of the\\nStraits Settlements. During World War II, Singapore was occupied\\nby Japan in 1942 and returned to British control as a separate Crown\\ncolony following Japan\\'s surrender in 1945. Singapore gained self-\\ngove rnance in 1959 and, in 1963, became part of the new federation\\nof Malaysia, alongside Malaya, North Borneo, and Sarawak.\\nIdeological differences, most notably the perceived encroachment of\\nthe egalitarian \"Malaysian Malaysia\" political ideology led by Lee\\nKuan Yew into the other constituent entities of Malaysia—at the\\nperceived expense of the bumiputera and the policies of Ketuanan\\nMelayu—eventually led to Singapore\\'s expulsion from the\\nfederation two years later; Singapore became an independent\\nsovereign country in 1965.\\nAfter early years of turbulence and despite lacking natural resources\\nand a hinterland, the nation rapidly developed to become one of the\\nFour Asian Tigers.

Singapore is\\nalso a member of the United Nations, the World Trade Organization,\\nthe East Asia Summit, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the\\nCommonwealth of Nations.\\nThe English name of \"Singapore\" is an anglicisation of the native\\nMalay name for the country, Singapur a (pronounced [siŋapura]),\\nwhich was in turn derived from the Sanskrit word for \\'lion city\\'\\n(Sanskrit: \\x00 स \\x00ह प ुर; romanised: Si ṃhapur a; Brahmi: 𑀲 𑀺 𑀁 𑀳 \\x00 𑀭; literally\\n\"lion city\"; si ṃha means \\'lion\\', pura means \\'city\\' or \\'fortress\\').[9]\\nPulau Ujong was one of the earliest references to Singapore Island,\\nwhich corresponds  to a Chinese account from the third century\\nreferred to a place as Pú Luó Zhōng  (Chinese: 蒲 \\x00 中), a\\ntranscription of the Malay name for \\'island at the end of a\\npeninsula\\'.[10] Early references to the name Temasek (or Tumasik)\\nare found in the Nagarakretagama, a Javanese eulogy written in\\n1365, and a Vietnamese source from the same time period. The\\nname possibly means Sea Town, being derived from the Malay\\ntasek, meaning \\'sea\\' or \\'lake\\'.[11] The Chinese traveller Wang\\nDayuan visited a place around 1330 named Danmaxi (Chinese: 淡\\n⾺\\x00; pinyin: Dànm ǎ xí; Wade–Giles: Tan Ma Hsi) or Tam ma siak,Name and etymologyStandard Time)\\nDate format dd/mm/yyyy\\nDriving side left\\nCalling code +65\\nISO 3166 code SG\\nInternet TLD .sgdepending on pronunc iation; this may be a transcription of Temasek,\\nalternatively, it may be a combination of the Malay Tanah  meaning\\n\\'land\\' and Chinese xi meaning \\'tin\\', which was traded on the\\nisland.[12][11]\\nVariations of the name Si ṃhapur a were used for a number of cities\\nthroughout  the region prior to the establishment of the Kingdom  of\\nSingapura. In Hindu–B uddhi st culture, lions were associated with\\npower and protection, which may explain the attraction of such a\\nname.[13][14] The name Singapur a supplanted Temasek sometime before the 15th century, after the establishment of\\nthe Kingdom  of Singapura on the island by a fleeing Sumatran Raja (prince) from Palembang. However, the precise\\ntime and reason for the name change is unknow n. The semi-historical Malay Annals state that Temasek was\\nchristened Singapur a by Sang Nila Utama, a 13th-century Sumatran Raja from Palembang. The Annals state that\\nSang Nila Utama encountered a strange beast on the island that he took to be a lion. Seeing this as an omen, he\\nestablished the town of Singapur a where he encountered the beast.[15]: 37, 88–92 [16]: 30–31  The second hypot hesis,\\ndrawn from Portugue se sources, postulates that this mythical story is based on the real life Parameswara of\\nPalembang. Parameswara declared independence from Majapahit and mounted a Lion Throne. After then being\\ndriven into exile by the Javanese, he usurped control over Temasek. It is possible that he rechristened the area as\\nSingapur a, recalling the throne he had been driven from.[17]\\nUnder Japanese occupation, Singapore was renamed Syonan  (Japanese: 昭 南, Hepburn: Shōnan ), meaning \\'light of\\nthe south\\'.[18][19] Singapore is sometimes referred to by the nickname the \"Garden City\", in reference to its parks and\\ntree-lined streets.[20] Another informal name, the \"Little Red Dot\", was adopted after an article in the Asian Wall\\nStreet Journal of 4 Augus t 1998 said that Indone sian President B. J. Habibie referred to Singapore as a red dot on a\\nmap.[21][22][23][24]\\nIn 1299, according to the Malay Annals, the Kingdom  of Singapura was founde d on the island by Sang Nila\\nUtama.[25] Although the historicity of the accounts as given in the Malay Annals is the subject of academic\\ndebates,[26] it is nevertheless know n from various documents that Singapore in the 14th century, then know n as\\nTemasek, was a trading port unde r the influence of both the Majapahit Empire and the Siamese kingdoms,[27] and\\nwas a part of the Indosphere.[28][29][30][31][32] These Indianised kingdom s were characterised by surprising\\nresilience, political integrity and administrative stability.[33] Historical sources also indicate that around the end of the\\n14th century, its ruler Parameswara was attacked by either the Majapahit or the Siamese, forcing him to move to\\nMalacca where he founde d the Sultanate of Malacca.[34] Archaeological evidence sugge sts that the main settlement\\non Fort Canning was abandone d around this time, although a small trading settlement continued in Singapore for\\nsome time afterwards.[17] In 1613, Portugue se raiders burned dow n the settlement, and the island faded into obs curity\\nfor the next two centuries.[35] By then, Singapore was nominally part of the Johor Sultanate.[36] The wider maritime\\nregion and m uch trade was unde r Dutch control for the following pe riod after the Dutch conque st of Malacca.[37]\\nThe British gove rnor Stamford Raffles arrived in Singapore on 28 January 1819 and soon recognised the island as a\\nnatural choice for the new port.[40] The island was then nominally ruled by Tengku Abdul Rahman, the Sultan of\\nJohor, who was controlled by the Dutch and the Bugis.[41] However, the Sultanate was weakened by factional\\ndivision: Abdul Rahman, the Temenggong of Johor to Tengku  Abdul Rahman, as well as his officials, were loyal to\\nthe Sultan\\'s elder brother Tengku Long, who was living in exile in Penyengat Island, Riau Islands. With the\\nTemenggong\\' s help, Raffles managed to smuggle Tengku Long back into Singapore. Raffles offered to recogniseHistory\\nAncient Singapore\\nBritish colonisationLetter from William Farquhar to Sultan Muhammad\\nKanzul Alam, the 21st Sultan of Brunei, dated 28\\nNovember 1819.

Singapore became\\nthe regional capital in 1836.[46] Prior to Raffles\\' arrival, there were only about a thousand people living on the island,\\nmostly indigenous  Malays along with a handful of Chinese.[47] By 1860 the popul ation had swelled to over 80,000,\\nmore than half being Chinese.[45] Many of these early immigrants came to work on the pepper and gambier\\nplantations.[48] In 1867, the Straits Settlements were separated from British India, coming unde r the direct control of\\nBritain.[49] Later, in the 1890s , when the rubbe r indus try became established in Malaya and Singapore,[50] the island\\nbecame a global centre for rubbe r sorting and export.[45]\\nSingapore was not greatly affected by the First World War (1914–18) , as the\\nconflict did not spread to Southeast Asia. The only significant event during\\nthe war was the 1915 Singapore Mutiny by Muslim sepoys  from British\\nIndia, who were garrisoned in Singapore.[51] After hearing rumours that they\\nwere to be sent to fight the Ottoman Empire, a Muslim state, the soldiers\\nrebelled, killing their officers and several British civilians before the mutiny\\nwas suppressed by non- Muslim troops arriving from Johore and Burma.[52]\\nAfter World War I, the British built the large Singapore Naval Base as part of\\nthe defensive Singapore strategy.[53] Originally announc ed in 1921, the\\nconstruction of the base proceeded at a slow pace until the Japanese invasion\\nof Manchuria in 1931. Costing $60 million and not fully completed in 1938, it was none theless the largest dry dock\\nin the world, the third-largest floating dock, and had enough fuel tanks to suppor t the entire British navy for six\\nmonths.[53][54][55] The base was defended by heavy 15-inch (380 mm) naval guns stationed at Fort Siloso, Fort\\nCanning and Labrador, as well as a Royal Air Force airfield at Tengah Air Base. Winston Churchill touted it as the\\n\"Gibraltar of the East\", and military discussions often referred to the base as simply \"East of Suez\". However, the\\nBritish Home Fleet was stationed in Europe, and the British could not afford to build a second fleet to protect their\\ninterests in Asia. The plan was for the Home Fleet to sail quickly to Singapore in the event of an emergency. As a\\nconsequence, after World War II broke out in 1939, the fleet was fully occupied with defending Britain, leaving\\nSingapore vulnerable to Japanese invasion.[56][57]\\nWorld War IIBritish evacuation in 1945 after the\\nJapanese surrender. Kallang Airport\\'s\\ncontrol tower near the city has been\\nconserved.During the Pacific War, the Japanese invasion of Malaya culminated in the\\nBattle of Singapore. When the British force of 60,000 troops surrendered on\\n15 February 1942, British prime minister Winston Churchill called the defeat\\n\"the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history\".[58] British and\\nEmpire losses during the fighting for Singapore were heavy, with a total of\\nnearly 85,000 personne l captured.[59] About 5,000 were killed or\\nwounde d,[60] of which Australians made up the majority.[61][62][63] Japanese\\ncasualties during the fighting in Singapore amounted to 1,714 killed and\\n3,378 wounde d.[59][f] The occupation was to become a major turning point\\nin the histories of several nations, including those of Japan, Britain, and\\nSingapore. Japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as\\ndeciding the general situation of the war.[64][65] Between 5,000 and 25,000\\nethnic Chinese people were killed in the subsequent Sook Ching\\nmassacre.[66] British forces had planned to liberate Singapore in 1945/ 1946;\\nhowever, the war ended before these operations could be carried out .[67][68]\\nAfter the Japanese surrender to the Allies on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and\\ndisorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British, Australian, and Indian troops  led by Lord Louis\\nMountbatten returned to Singapore to receive the formal surrender of Japanese forces in the region from General\\nSeishirō Itagaki on behalf of General Hisaichi Terauchi on 12 September 1945.[67][68] Meanwhile, Tomoyuki\\nYamashita was tried by a US military commission for war crimes, but not for crimes committed by his troops  in\\nMalaya or Singapore. He was convicted and ha nged in the Philippines on 23 F ebruary 1946.[69][70]\\nMuch of Singapore\\'s infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including those needed to supply utilities. A\\nshortage of food led to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. A series of strikes in 1947 caused\\nmassive stoppa ges in public transport and other services. However, by late 1947 the econom y began to recover,\\nfacilitated by a growing international demand for tin and rubbe r.[71] The failure of Britain to successfully defend its\\ncolony against the Japanese changed its image in the eyes of Singaporeans. British Military Administration ended on\\n1 April 1946, and Singapore became a separate Crown Colony.[71] In July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative\\nCounc ils were established and the election of six members of the Legislative Counc il was scheduled for the\\nfollowing ye ar.[72]\\nDuring the 1950s , Chinese communists, with strong ties to the trade unions and Chinese schools, waged a guerrilla\\nwar against the gove rnment, leading to the Malayan Emergency. The 1954 National Service riots, Hock Lee bus\\nriots, and Chinese middle schools riots in Singapore were all linked to these events.[73] David Marshall, pro-\\nindependence leader of the Labour Front, won Singapore\\'s first general election in 1955.[74] He led a delegation to\\nLondon , and Britain rejected his demand for complete self-rule. He resigned and was replaced by Lim Yew Hock in\\n1956, and after further negotiations Britain agreed to grant Singapore full internal self-gove rnment for all matters\\nexcept defence and foreign affairs on 3 June 1959.[75] Days before, in the 30 May 1959 election, the People\\'s Action\\nParty (PAP) won a landslide victory.[76] Governor Sir William Allmond Codrington Goode  served as the first Yang\\ndi-Pertuan Negara (Head of State).[77]\\nPAP leaders believed that Singapore\\'s future lay with Malaya, due to strong ties between the two. It was thought  that\\nreuniting with Malaya would benefit the econom y by creating a common market, alleviating ongoi ng unemployment\\nwoes in Singapore. However, a sizeable left-wing faction of the PAP was strongly oppos ed to the merger, fearing a\\nloss of influence, and hence formed the Barisan Sosialis, splitting from the PAP.[78][79] The ruling party of Malaya,\\nUnited Malays National Organisation (UMNO), was staunchly anti-communist, and it was suspected UMNO wouldPost-war period\\nWithin MalaysiaSingapore thrived as an entrepôt.

UMNO, initially sceptical of the\\nidea of a merger due to distrust of the PAP gove rnment and concern that the\\nlarge ethnic Chinese popul ation in Singapore would alter the racial balance in\\nMalaya on which their political power base depended, became suppor tive of\\nthe idea of the merger due to joint fear of a communist takeover.[80]\\nOn 27 May 1961, Malaya\\'s prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, made a\\nsurprise proposal for a new Federation called Malaysia, which would unite\\nthe current and former British possessions in the region: the Federation of\\nMalaya, Singapore, Brunei, North Borneo, and Sarawak.[80][81] UMNO\\nleaders believed that the additional Malay popul ation in the Bornean\\nterritories would balance Singapore\\'s Chinese popul ation.[75] The British\\ngove rnment, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore\\nfrom becoming a haven for communism.[82] To obtain a mandate for a\\nmerger, the PAP held a referendum  on the merger. This referendum  included a choice of different terms for a merger\\nwith Malaysia and had no option for avoiding merger altogether.[83][84] On 16 September 1963, Singapore joined\\nwith Malaya, the North Borneo, and Sarawak to form the new Federation of Malaysia unde r the terms of the\\nMalaysia Agreement.[85] Under this Agreement, Singapore had a relatively high level of autonom y compared to the\\nother states of Malaysia.[86]\\nIndone sia opposed the formation of Malaysia due to its own claims over Borneo and launched Konfrontasi\\n(\"Confrontation\" in Indone sian) in response to the formation of Malaysia.[87] On 10 March 1965,  a bomb planted by\\nIndone sian saboteurs on a mezzanine floor of MacDonald House exploded, killing three people and injuring 33\\nothers. It was the deadliest of at least 42 bomb incidents which occurred during the confrontation.[88] Two members\\nof the Indone sian Marine Corps, Osman bin Haji Mohamed Ali and Harun bin Said, were eventually convicted and\\nexecuted for the crime.[89] The explosion caused US$250,000 (equivalent to US$2,417,107 in 2023)  in damages to\\nMacDonald House.[90][91]\\nEven after the merger, the Singaporean gove rnment and the Malaysian central gove rnment disagreed on many\\npolitical and econom ic issues.[92] Despite an agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face\\nrestrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore did not extend to Sabah and Sarawak the\\nfull extent of the loans agreed to for econom ic development of the two eastern states. Talks soon broke down, and\\nabusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides. This led to communal strife in Singapore, culminating in the\\n1964 race riots.[93] On 7 Augus t 1965, Malaysian prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, seeing no alternative to\\navoid further bloods hed (and with the help of secret negotiations by PAP leaders, as revealed in 2015)[94] advised the\\nParliament of Malaysia that it should vote to expel Singapore from Malaysia.[92] On 9 August 1965, the Malaysian\\nParliament voted 126 to 0 to move a bill to amend the constitution, expelling Singapore from Malaysia, which left\\nSingapore as a newly independent country.[75][95][96][97][98][94]\\nAfter being expelled from Malaysia, Singapore became independent as the Republic of Singapore on 9 August\\n1965,[99][100] with Lee Kuan Yew and Yusof bin Ishak as the first prime minister and president respectively.[101][102]\\nIn 1967, the country co-founde d the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).[103] Race riots broke out\\nonce more in 1969.[104] Lee Kuan Yew\\'s emphasis on rapid economic growth, suppor t for business entrepreneurship,\\nand limitations on internal democracy shaped Singapore\\'s policies for the next half-century.[105][106] Economic\\ngrowth continued throughout  the 1980s , with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at\\nabout 8% up until 1999. During the 1980s , Singapore began to shift towards high-tech industries, such as the wafer\\nfabrication sector, in order to remain competitive as neighbour ing countries began manufacturing w ith cheaper labour.Republic of SingaporeLee Kuan Yew, the first\\nprime minister of\\nSingapore.\\nThe Istana is the official residence\\nand office of the president, as well\\nas the working office of the prime\\nminister.Singapore Changi Airport was opened in 1981 and Singapore Airlines was formed.[107]\\nThe Port of Singapore became one of the world\\'s busiest ports and the service and\\ntourism indus tries also grew immensely dur ing this period.[108][109]\\nThe PAP has remained in power since independence. Some activists and oppos ition\\npoliticians see the government\\'s strict regulation of political and media activities as an\\ninfringement on political rights.[110] In response, Singapore has seen several significant\\npolitical changes, such as the introduction of the non-constituency members of\\nparliament in 1984 to allow up to three losing candidates from oppos ition parties to be\\nappointed as MPs. Group representation constituencies (GRCs) were introduc ed in 1988\\nto create multi-seat electoral divisions, intended to ensure minority representation in\\nparliament.[111] Nominated members of parliament were introduc ed in 1990 to allow\\nnon-elected non-partisan MPs.[112] The constitution was amended in 1991 to provide\\nfor an elected president who has veto power in the use of past reserves and appointments\\nto certain publ ic offices.[113]\\nIn 1990, Goh Chok Tong succeeded Lee and became Singapore\\'s second prime minister.[114] During Goh\\'s tenure,\\nthe country went through the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2003 SARS outbreak.[115][116] In 2004, Lee Hsien\\nLoong , the eldest son of Lee Kuan Yew, became the country\\'s third prime minister.[116] Lee Hsien Loong\\' s tenure\\nincluded the 2008 global financial crisis, the resolution of a dispute over land ownership at Tanjong Pagar railway\\nstation between Singapore and Malaysia, and the introduc tion of the two integrated resorts (IRs), located at the\\nMarina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa.[117] The PAP suffered its worst ever electoral results in 2011,\\nwinning just 60% of votes, amidst debate over issues including the influx of foreign workers and the high cost of\\nliving.[118] On 23 March 2015 , Lee Kuan Yew died, and a one-week period of public mourning was observed\\nnationwide.[106] Subsequently, the PAP regained its dominance in Parliament through the September general\\nelection, receiving 69.9%  of the popul ar vote,[119] although this remained lower than the 2001 tally of 75.3%[120]\\nand the 1968 tally of 86.7% .[121] The 2020 election held in July saw the PAP drop to 61% of the vote, while the\\nWorkers\\' Party took 10 of the 93 seats, the highest number ever won by another party.[122] On 15 May 2024,\\nLawrence Wong became Singapore\\'s fourth Prime Minister; he is the first prime minister born after\\nindependence.[123]\\nSingapore is a parliamentary republic based on the Westminster system. The\\nConstitution of Singapore is the supreme law of the country, establishing the\\nstructure and respons ibility of gove rnance. The President is the head of\\nstate.[124][125] The gove rnance of Singapore is separated into three branches:\\nExecutive: The executive consists of the cabinet, led by the prime\\nminister, and the Attorney General\\'s Chambers led by the\\nAttorney-General.[126] The cabinet is collectively responsible for\\nall government policies and the day-to-day administration of the\\naffairs of state. It is typically composed of members of the\\nSingapore Parliament. The prime minister is appointed by the\\nPresident, and the ministers in the cabinet and the attorney-\\ngeneral are appointed by the president, acting on the advice and\\nconsent of the prime minister. The prime minister is the effective\\nhead of the executive branch of government.[127][124]\\nLegislature: The Singapore Parliament is unicameral and, together with the president, comprises the\\nlegislature.[128] Members of Parliament (MP) consist of elected, non-constituency, and nominated\\nmembers. The majority of MPs are elected into parliament at a general election. The Singapore\\nParliament is collectively responsible for enacting the laws governing the state.[124] The presidentGovernment and politicsThe Supreme Court (left) and the\\nParliament House (right) where the\\nSingapore Parliament convenes\\nThe Speakers\\' Corner at Hong Lim\\nPark provides a public demonstration\\narea, which are often restricted in\\nother parts of the country.holds limited discretionary powers of oversight over the\\ngovernment. The president\\'s veto powers are further subject to\\nparliamentary overruling.[129][130]\\nJudiciary: The judiciary\\'s function is to independently administer\\njustice and is headed by the Chief Justice. The judges and\\njudicial commissioners are appointed by the president on the\\nadvice of the prime minister.[131] The Supreme Court and State\\nCourts adjudicates in civil disputes between persons, convicts or\\nacquits accused persons in criminal prosecutions, and interprets\\nlaws to decide on its constitutionality. Any law or provision of a\\nlaw found to be unconstitutional can be struck down by the\\nSupreme Court.[132]\\nThe president is directly elected by popul ar vote for a renewable six-year\\nterm. Requirements for this position, which were enacted by the PAP\\ngove rnment, are extremely stringent, such that only a handful of people\\nqualify for the candidacy.[133][134] These qualifications include that a\\ncandidate needs to be a person at least 45 years of age who is no longe r a\\nmember of a political party, to either have held public office for at least 3\\nyears in a number of specific public service leadership roles, or to have 3\\nyears experience as chief executive of a fully profitable private sector\\ncompany with at least S$500 million in shareholders\\' equity, be a resident in\\nSingapore for at least 10 years, not have a criminal record, and\\nmore.[135][134][136] Candidates must also \"satisfy\" the Presidential Elections\\nCommittee (PEC) that he or she is a person of integrity, good character and\\nreputation.\\nThe Constitution requires that presidential elections be \"reserved\" for a racial\\ncommunity if no one from that ethnic group has been elected to the presidency in the five most recent terms.[137]\\nOnly members of that community may qualify as candidates in a reserved presidential election.[138] In the 2017\\npresidential election, this combination of stringent requirements and a reserved election that required the candidate to\\nbe of the 13% Malay ethnic group led to the PEC approving a single candidate for the presidency;[139] Halimah\\nYacob, considered part of the Malay community, won in an uncontested election. She also became Singapore\\'s first\\nfemale president.\\nMembers of Parliament (MPs) are elected at least every five years (or soone r with a snap election). The 14th and\\ncurrent Parliament has 103 members; 93 were directly elected from the 31 constituencies, nine are nonpa rtisan\\nnominated members appointed by the president, and three are non-constituency members from opposition parties\\nwho were not elected in the last general election but appointed to the legislature to increase oppos ition party\\nrepresentation. In group representation constituencies (GRCs), political parties assemble teams of candidates to\\ncontest elections. At least one MP in a GRC must be of an ethnic minority background. All elections are held using\\nfirst-past-the-post voting.[140] MPs host weekly political surgeries, called \"Meet-the-People Sessions\", where they\\nhelp constituents resolve personal issues which can be related to hous ing, financial assistance, and immigration.[141]\\nThe People\\'s Action Party occupies a dominant position in Singaporean politics, having won large parliamentary\\nmajorities in every election since self-gove rnance was granted in 1959. The PAP, self-described as pragmatic, have a\\nsyncretic ideology combining free-market principles, civil nationalism, and welfarism.[142][143][144] Despite\\npromulgating restrictions on civil liberties, Singapore unde r the PAP has seen consistent econom ic growth and\\npolitical stability.[145] The most represented and popul ar opposition party is the centre-left Workers\\' Party, which\\nholds 8 seats in Parliament.[122]The long-standing hegemony of the People\\'s Action Party has led to Singapore being described by academics as an\\nilliberal democracy,[146][147][148][149] or a soft-authoritarian state in which the PAP faces little to no feasible political\\ncompetition to its rule of the country.[150][151][152][153] The multi-party democratic process of Singapore has been\\ndescribed as \"minimal\" in comparison to the state\\'s focus on econom ic development and social order.[154] According\\nto Gordon P. Means, professor emeritus of political science at McMaster University, Singapore reinvented the\\n\"benevolent\" yet \"highly authoritarian\" colonial system of gove rnance inherited from Britain rather than forging a full\\ndemocracy. A conservative ideology of \"Asian values\" evolved to replace British rule, based on \"communal loyalty,\\ndistrust of gove rnment, and avoidance of individual or collective respons ibility for wider public interests\", with less\\nregard for human rights in the nascent Western sense.[155] The fact that \"neither the public nor elites had experience\\nwith democracy\" helped create Singapore\\'s political culture, as dominated by status-focused hierarchies committed to\\neconom ic development.[151] The legacy of Asian values and the limited political culture within Singapore has led to\\nthe country being de scribed as \"classic illustration of  soft authoritarianism\",[154] and \"profoundl y illiberal\".[156]\\nThe judicial system is based on English common law, continuing the legal tradition established during British rule\\nand with substantial local differences. Criminal law is based on the Indian Penal Code originally intended for British\\nIndia, and w as at the time as a crown colony a lso adopted by t he British colonial authorities in Singapore and remains\\nthe basis of the criminal code in the country with a few exceptions, amendments and repeals since it came into\\nforce.[157] Trial by jury was abolished in 1970.[158] Singapore is know n for its strict laws and conservative stances\\non crime; both corporal punishment (by caning)[159][160] and capital punishment (by hanging) are retained as legal\\npenalties.[161]\\nThe right to freedom of speech and association is guaranteed by Article 14(1) of the Constitution of Singapore,\\nalthough there are provisions in the subsequent subsection that regulate them.[162] The gove rnment has restricted\\nfreedom of speech and freedom of the press as well as some civil and political rights.[163] In 2023, Singapore was\\nranked 129th out of 180 nations by Reporters Without Borders on the global Press Freedom Index.[164] Freedom\\nHouse ranks Singapore as \"partly free\" in its Freedom in the World report,[165][145] and the Econom ist Intelligence\\nUnit ranks Singapore as a \"flawed democracy\", the second freest rank of four, in its \"Democracy Index\".[166][167]\\nAll public gatherings of five or more people require police permits, and protests may legally be held only at the\\nSpeakers\\' Corner.[168]\\nIn the Corruption Perceptions Index, which ranks countries by \"perceived levels of public sector corruption\",\\nSingapore has consistently ranked as one of the least corrupt countries in the world, in spite of being illiberal.[169]\\nSingapore\\'s unique combination of  a strong, soft authoritarian gove rnment with an emphasis on meritocracy is know n\\nas the \"Singapore model\", and is regarded as a key factor behind Singapore\\'s political stability, econom ic growth, and\\nharmonious social order.[170][171][172][173] In 2021, the World Justice Project\\'s Rule of Law Index ranked Singapore\\nas 17th overall among the world\\'s 193 countries for adherence to the rule of law. Singapore ranked high on the\\nfactors of order and security (#3), absence of corruption (#3), regulatory enforcement (#4), civil justice (#8), and\\ncriminal justice (#7), and ranked significantly lower on factors of open gove rnment (#34), constraints on gove rnment\\npowers (#32), and funda mental rights (#38).[174]\\nSingapore\\'s stated foreign policy priority is maintaining security in Southeast Asia and surrounding territories. An\\nunde rlying principle is political and econom ic stability in the region.[175] It has diplomatic relations with more than\\n180 s overeign states.[176]\\nAs one of the five foundi ng members of ASEAN,[177] Singapore is a strong suppor ter of the ASEAN Free Trade\\nArea (AFTA) and the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA); it is also the host of the APEC Secretariat.[178] Singapore is\\nalso a foundi ng m ember of The Forum of Small States (FOSS), a voluntary and informal grouping at the UN.[179]Foreign relationsPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the 2017\\nG20 meeting in Germany.

China has been Singapore\\'s largest trading partner since 2013, after surpassing\\nMalaysia.[192][193][194][195][196] Singapore and the United States share a long-standing close relationship, in\\nparticular in defence, the econom y, health, and education. Singapore has also increased co-operation with ASEAN\\nmembers and China to strengthen regional security and fight terrorism, and participated in ASEAN\\'s first joint\\nmaritime exercise with China in 2018.[197] It has also given support to the US-led coalition to fight terrorism, with\\nbilateral co-operation in counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation initiatives, and joint military exercises.[185]\\nAs Singapore has diplomatic relations with both the United States and North Korea, and was one of the few\\ncountries that have relationships with both countries,[198] in June 2018, it hosted a historic summit between US\\nPresident Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the first-ever meeting between the sitting leaders of\\nthe two nations.[199][200] It also hosted the Ma–Xi meeting in 2015, the first meeting between the political leaders of\\nthe two sides of the Taiwan Strait since the end of  the Chinese Civil War in 1950.[201][202][203]\\nThe Singaporean military, arguably the most technologically advanced in\\nSoutheast Asia,[204] consists of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the\\nDigital and Intelligence Service. It is seen as the guarantor of the country\\'s\\nindependence,[205] translating into Singapore culture, involving all citizens in\\nthe country\\'s defence.[206] The gove rnment spends 4.9%  of the country\\'s\\nGDP on the military—hi gh by regional standards[204]—and one out of every\\nfour dollars of gove rnment spending is spent on de fence.[207]\\nAfter its independence, Singapore had only two infantry regiments\\ncommanded by British officers. Considered too small to provide effective\\nsecurity for the new country, the development of its military forces became a\\npriority.[208] In addition, in October 1971, Britain pulled its military out of\\nSingapore, leaving behind only a small British, Australian and New ZealandMilitaryRepublic of Singapore Air Force\\nBlack Knights perform at the\\nSingapore Air Show.force as a token military presence.[209] A great deal of initial suppor t came from Israel,[208] a country unrecognised\\nby Singapore\\'s neighbour ing Muslim-majority nations of Malaysia and Indone sia.[210][211][212] The Israel Defense\\nForces (IDF) commanders were tasked by the Singapore Government to create the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)\\nfrom scratch, and Israeli instructors were brought  in to train Singaporean soldiers. Military courses were conduc ted\\naccording to the IDF\\'s format, and Singapore adopted a system of conscription and reserve service based on the\\nIsraeli model.[208] Singapore still maintains strong security ties with Israel and is one of the biggest buye rs of Israeli\\narms and w eapons systems,[213] with one  recent example being the MATADOR anti-tank w eapon.[214]\\nThe SAF is being developed to respond to a wide range of issues in both conve ntional and unconve ntional warfare.\\nThe Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) is respons ible for procuring resources for the military.[215]\\nThe geographic restrictions of Singapore mean that the SAF must plan to fully repulse an attack, as they cannot fall\\nback and re-group. The small size of the popul ation has also affected the way the SAF has been designed, with a\\nsmall active force and a large num ber of reserves.[206]\\nSingapore has conscription for all able-bodied males at age 18, except those\\nwith a criminal record or who can prove that their loss would bring hardship\\nto their families. Males who have yet to complete pre-university education,\\nare awarded the Public Service Commission (PSC) scholarship, or are\\npursuing a local medical degree can opt to defer their draft.[216][217] Though\\nnot required to perform military service, the number of women in the SAF\\nhas been increasing: since 1989 they have been allowed to fill military\\nvocations formerly reserved for men. Before induc tion into a specific branch\\nof the armed forces, recruits unde rgo at least nine weeks of basic military\\ntraining.[218]\\nBecause of the scarcity of open land on the main island, training involving\\nactivities such as live firing and amphibious warfare are often carried out on smaller islands, typically barred to\\ncivilian access. However, large-scale drills, considered too dangerous to be performed in the country, have been\\nperformed in other countries such as Brunei, Indone sia, Thailand and the United States. In general, military exercises\\nare held with foreign forces once or twice per week.[206] Due to airspace and land constraints, the Republic of\\nSingapore Air Force (RSAF) maintains a number of overseas bases in Australia, the United States, and France. The\\nRSAF\\'s 130 Squadron is based in RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia,[219] and its 126 Squadron is based in the\\nOakey Army Aviation Centre, Queensland.[220] The RSAF has one squadron—t he 150 Squadron—ba sed in Cazaux\\nAir Base in southern France.[221] The RSAF\\'s overseas detachments in the United States are: Luke Air Force Base in\\nArizona, Marana in Arizona, Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, and Andersen Air Force Base in\\nGuam.[222][223][224]\\nThe SAF has sent forces to assist in operations outside the country, in areas such as Iraq,[225] and\\nAfghanistan,[226][227] in both military and civilian roles. In the region, they have helped to stabilise East Timor and\\nhave provided aid to Aceh in Indone sia following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthqua ke and tsunami. Since 2009, the\\nRepublic of Singapore Navy (RSN) has deployed ships to the Gulf of Aden to aid in countering piracy efforts as part\\nof Task Force 151.[228] The SAF also helped in relief efforts during Hurricane Katrina,[229] and Typhoon\\nHaiyan.[230] Singapore is part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), a military alliance with Australia,\\nMalaysia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom .[206] In 2023, Singapore was ranked the 6th most peaceful\\ncountry on t he Global Peace Index.[231]\\nCapital puni shment is a legal and enforced penalty in Singapore. The country is one of four in the developed world to\\nretain the death penalty, along with the United States, Japan and Taiwan. Particularly, its use against drug trafficking\\nhas been a source of contention with various non-gove rnmental organisations, regarded by some as a victimlessHuman rightsSkyline of Singapore\\'s Downtown Corecrime. The gove rnment has responde d that it has \"no doubt s\" that it is the right policy and that there is \"clear\\nevidence\" of serious deterrence, and that the law should be looke d at upon in the wider context of \"saving lives\",\\nparticularly citizens.[232] In 2004, Amnesty International claimed that some legal provisions of the Singapore system\\nfor the death penalty conflict with \"the right to be presumed innoc ent until proven guilty\".[233] The gove rnment has\\ndisputed Amnesty\\'s claims, stating that their \"position on abolition of the death penalty is by no means uncontested\\ninternationally\" and that the report contains \"grave errors of facts and m isrepresentations\".[234]\\nFrom 1938 to 2023,  sexual relations between men were technically illegal unde r Section 377A  of the Penal Code,\\nfirst introduc ed during British colonial rule.[235] During the last few decades, this law was mostly unenforced and\\npressure to repeal it increased as homosexuality became more accepted by Singaporean society.[236] Meanwhile,\\nsexual relations between women had always been legal.[237] In 2022, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong  announced\\nthat Singapore would repeal 377A , effectively decriminalising homosexual behaviour. Nevertheless, he added that\\nthe repeal will not affect the recognition of \"traditional familial and societal norms,\" including how marriage is\\ndefined, leaving the legal status of same-sex marriage unchanged for the time, although the possibility of civil unions\\nwas not officially ruled out.[238] Lee described this as a compromise between the conservative (and often religious)\\nand progressive elements of Singaporean society to prevent further political fracturing.[239] The law was officially\\nrepealed on 3 J anuary 2023.[240]\\nPink Dot SG, an event held in suppor t of the LGBT community, has drawn thousands of people annua lly since 2009\\nwith increasing attendance.[241] According to a survey conduc ted by the Institute of Policy Studies in 2019,\\nSingaporean society has become more liberal on LGBT rights. In the survey, more than 20% of people said that\\nsexual relations between adults of the same sex were not wrong at all or not wrong most of the time, up from 10% in\\n2013. The survey found that 27% felt the same way about same-sex marriage (an increase from 15% in 2013)  and\\n30% did so about same-sex couples adopting a child (an increase from 24% in 2013) .[242][243] In 2021,  six\\nSingaporeans protested for improved trans protections in the educational system outside the Ministry of Education\\nheadqua rters at Buona  Vista.[244]\\nPimps often traffic women from neighbour ing countries such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam at their brothels as\\nwell as rented apartments and hostels for higher profit margins when they get a cut from customers.[245][246] In\\nrespons e, amendments were made to the Women\\'s Charter by the gove rnment in 2019 to legislate more serious\\npunishments for traffickers, including imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine of S$100,000.[247]\\nSingapore has a highly developed\\nmarket econom y, based historically on\\nextended entrepôt trade. Along with\\nHong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan,\\nSingapore is one of the Four Asian\\nTigers, and has surpassed its peers in\\nterms of Gross Domestic Produc t (GDP)\\nper capita. Between 1965 and 1995,\\ngrowth rates averaged around 6 per cent\\nper annum , transforming the living standards of the popul ation.[248]\\nThe Singaporean econom y is regarded as free,[249] innova tive,[250] dyna mic[251] and business-friendly.[252] For\\nseveral years, Singapore has been one of the few[253] countries with an AAA credit rating from the big three, and the\\nonly Asian country to achieve this rating.[254] Singapore attracts a large amount of foreign investment as a result of its\\nlocation, skilled workforce, low tax rates, advanced infrastructure and zero-tolerance against corruption.[255] It was\\nthe world\\'s 4th most competitive econom y in 2023, according to the International Institute for Management\\nDevelopment\\'s World Competitiveness Ranking of 64 countries,[256] with the highest GDP (PPP) perEconomySingapore Airlines, the country\\'s flag\\ncarrier, celebrated the nation\\'s 2015\\nGolden Jubilee with a flag livery on\\nits Airbus A380.capita.[257][258][259] Roughly 44 percent of the Singaporean workforce is made up of non-Singaporeans.[260]\\nDespite market freedom, Singapore\\'s gove rnment operations have a significant stake in the econom y, contributing\\n22% of the GDP.[261] The city is a popul ar location for conferences and events.[262]\\nThe currency of Singapore is the Singapore dollar (SGD or S$), issued by\\nthe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).[263] It has been\\ninterchangeable with the Brunei dollar at par value since 1967.[264] MAS\\nmanages its monetary policy by allowing the Singapore dollar exchange rate\\nto rise or fall within an undisclosed trading band. This is different from most\\ncentral banks, which use interest rates to manage policy.[265] Singapore has\\nthe world\\'s eleventh largest foreign reserves,[266] and one of the highest net\\ninternational investment position pe r capita.[267][268]\\nSingapore has been identified as a tax haven[269] for the wealthy due to its\\nlow tax rates on personal income and tax exemptions on foreign-based\\nincome and capital gains. Individuals such as Australian millionaire retailer\\nBrett Blundy  and multi-billionaire Facebook co-founde r Eduardo Saverin are\\ntwo examples of wealthy individuals who have settled in Singapore.[270] In 2009, Singapore was removed from the\\nOrganisation for Econom ic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \"liste grise\" of tax havens,[271] and ranked\\nfourth on the Tax Justice Network\\'s 2015 Financial Secrecy Index of the world\\'s off-shore financial service\\nproviders, banking one-eighth of the world\\'s offshore capital, while \"providing numerous tax avoidance and evasion\\noppor tunities\".[272] In August 2016, The Straits Times reported that Indone sia had decided to create tax havens on\\ntwo islands near Singapore to bring Indone sian capital back into the tax base.[273] In October 2016, the Monetary\\nAuthority of Singapore admonished and fined UBS and DBS and withdrew Falcon Private Bank\\'s banking licence\\nfor their alleged role in the Malaysian Sovereign Fund s candal.[274][275]\\nIn 2016, Singapore was rated the world\\'s most expensive city for the third consecutive year by the Econom ist\\nIntelligence Unit,[276][277] and this remained true in 2018.[278] The gove rnment provides numerous assistance\\nprogrammes to the homeless and needy through the Ministry of Social and Family Development, so acute pove rty is\\nrare. Some of the programmes include providing financial assistance to needy hous eholds, providing free medical\\ncare at government hospitals, and paying for children\\'s tuition.[279][280][281] Other benefits include compensation for\\ngym fees to encourage citizens to exercise,[282] up to S$166,000 as a baby bonus  for each citizen,[283] heavily\\nsubsidised healthcare, financial aid for the disabled, the provision of reduced-cost laptops for poor students,[284]\\nrebates for costs such as public transport[285] and utility bills, and more.[286][287] As of 2018 Singapore\\'s ranking in\\nthe Human Development Index is 9th in the world, with an HDI value of 0.935.[288]\\nSingapore consists of 63 islands, including the main island, Pulau Ujong.[289] There are two man-made conne ctions\\nto Johor, Malaysia: the Johor–Singapore Causeway in the north and the Tuas Second Link in the west. Jurong Island,\\nPulau Tekong, Pulau Ubin and Sentosa are the largest of Singapore\\'s smaller islands. The highest natural point is\\nBukit Timah Hill at 163.63 m (537 ft).[290] Under British rule, Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands were part of\\nSingapore, and both were transferred to Australia in 1957.[291][292][293] Pedra Branca is the nation\\'s easternmost\\npoint.[294]\\nLand reclamation projects have increased Singapore\\'s land area from 580 km2 (220 sq mi) in the 1960s  to 710 km2\\n(270 sq mi) by 2015 , an increase of some 22% (130 km2).[295] The country is projected to reclaim another 56 km2\\n(20 sq mi).[296] Some projects involve merging smaller islands through land reclamation to form larger, more\\nfunctional and habitable islands, as has been done  with Jurong Island.[297] The type of sand used in reclamation is\\nfound in rivers and beaches, rather than deserts, and is in great demand worldwide. In 2010 Singapore importedGeographyAn outline of Singapore and the\\nsurrounding islands and waterways\\nSingapore Botanic Gardens is a\\nUNESCO World Heritage Site – one\\nof three gardens in the world, and the\\nonly tropical garden, to be\\nrecognised as such.\\nGardens by the Bayalmost 15 million tons of sand for its projects, the demand being such that\\nIndone sia, Malaysia, and Vietnam have all restricted or barred the export of\\nsand to Singapore in recent years. As a result, in 2016 Singapore switched to\\nusing polders for reclamation, in which an area is enclosed and then pumped\\ndry.[298]\\nSingapore\\'s urbanisation means that it has lost 95% of its historical\\nforests,[299] and now over half of the naturally occurring fauna and flora in\\nSingapore is present in nature reserves, such as the Bukit Timah Nature\\nReserve and the Sunge i Buloh Wetland Reserve, which comprise only 0.25%\\nof Singapore\\'s land area.[299] In 1967, to combat this decline in natural space,\\nthe gove rnment introduc ed the vision of making Singapore a \"garden\\ncity\",[300] aiming to improve quality of life.[301] Since then, nearly 10% of\\nSingapore\\'s land has been set aside for parks and nature reserves.[302] The\\ngove rnment has created plans to preserve the country\\'s remaining\\nwildlife.[303] Singapore\\'s well know n gardens include the Singapore Botanic\\nGardens, a 161-year-old tropical garden and Singapore\\'s first UNESCO\\nWorld Heritage Site.[304]\\nSingapore has a tropical rainforest\\nclimate (Köppe n: Af) with no\\ndistinctive seasons, uniform\\ntemperature and pressure, high\\nhumidity, and abunda nt\\nrainfall.[305][306] Temperatures usually range from 23 to 32 °C (73 to 90 °F).\\nWhile temperature does not vary greatly throughout  the year, there is a wetter\\nmonsoon season from November to February.[307]\\nFrom July to October, there is often haze caused by bush fires in neighbour ing Indone sia, usually from the island of\\nSumatra.[308] Singapore follows the GMT+8 time zone, one hour ahead of the typical zone for its geographical\\nlocation.[309] This causes the sun to rise and set particularly late during February, where the sun rises at 7:15 am and\\nsets around 7:20 pm. During July, the sun sets at around 7:15 pm. The earliest the sun rises and sets is in late October\\nand early November when the sun rises at 6:46 am and sets at 6:50 pm .[310]\\nSingapore recognises that climate change and rising sea levels in the decades ahead will have major implications for\\nits low-lying coastline.

From 2010 onward, people may register using a multi-racial\\nclassification, in which they may choos e one primary race and one seconda ry race,\\nbut no m ore than two.[393]\\nLike other developed countries in Asia, Singapore experienced a rapid decline in its\\ntotal fertility rate (TFR) beginning in the 1980s .[394] Since 2010, its TFR has largely plateaued at 1.1 children per\\nwoman, which is among the lowest in the world and well below the 2.1 needed to replace the popul ation.[395]\\nConsequently, the median age of Singaporean residents is among the highest in the world, at 42.8 in 2022 compared\\nto 39.6 ten years earlier.[396] Starting in 2001, the gove rnment introduc ed a series of programs to increase fertility,\\nincluding paid maternity leave, childcare subsidies, tax relief and rebates, one-time cash gifts, and grants for\\ncompanies that implement flexible work arrangements;[397] nevertheless, live births have continued to decline, hitting\\na record low in 2022.[398] Singapore\\'s immigration policy is designed to alleviate the decline and maintain its\\nworking-age popul ation.[399][400][401]\\n91% of resident households (i.e. hous eholds headed by a Singapore citizen or permanent resident) own the homes\\nthey live in, and the average hous ehold size is 3.43 persons (which include dependants who are neither citizens nor\\npermanent residents).[402][403] However, due to scarcity of land, 78.7%  of resident households live in subsidised,\\nhigh-rise, public hous ing apartments developed by the Housing and Development Board (HDB). Also, 75.9%  of\\nresident households live in properties that are equal to, or larger than, a four-room (i.e. three bedrooms plus one living\\nroom) HDB flat or in private hous ing.[404][405] Live-in foreign domestic workers are quite common in Singapore,\\nwith about 224,500 f oreign dom estic workers there, as of December 2013.[406]\\nLargest towns and planning areas in Singapore\\nSingapore Department of Statistics population report for June 2023 (https://www.singstat.gov.sg/fin\\nd-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/visualising-data/geographical-distribution-dashboar\\nd) RankNameRegionMunicipal\\npop.Rank Name RegionMunicipal\\npop.\\nBedok\\nTampines1Bedok East 279,51011Ang Mo KioNorth-\\nEast161,180\\nJurong West2TampinesEast 274,36012Bukit MerahCentral149,530\\n3Jurong\\nWestWest 259,74013Pasir Ris East 146,930\\n4SengkangNorth-\\nEast257,19014Bukit\\nPanjangWest 138,940\\n5WoodlandsNorth 255,39015Toa PayohCentral134,610\\n6HougangNorth-\\nEast227,61016SerangoonNorth-\\nEast118,780\\n7Yishun North 228,91017Geylang Central114,750Religion in Singapore, 2020[3]\\nReligion Percent\\nBuddhism 31.1%\\nNo religion 20.0%\\nChristianity 18.9%\\nIslam 15.6%\\nTaoism and folk religion 8.8%\\nHinduism 5.0%\\nOther religions 0.6%\\nLanguage used most frequently at home[3]\\nLanguage Percent\\nEnglish 48.3%\\nMandarin 29.9%\\nMalay 9.2%\\nOther Sinitic languages 8.7%\\nTamil 2.5%\\nOthers 1.4%\\nSengkang8Choa Chu\\nKangWest 191,48018SembawangNorth 109,120\\n9PunggolNorth-\\nEast194,75019Kallang Central100,870\\n10Bukit BatokWest 168,56020QueenstownCentral 99,690\\nMost major religious denominations are present in Singapore, with the Inter-Religious Organisation, Singapore (IRO)\\nrecognising 10 major religions in the city state.[407] A 2014 analysis by the Pew Research Center found Singapore to\\nbe the world\\'s most religiously diverse nation, w ith no s ingle religion claiming a majority.[408]\\nBuddhi sm is the most widely practised religion, with 31%\\nof residents declaring themselves adherents in the 2020\\ncensus.

The\\nproportion of Christians, Muslims, and the nonreligious\\nslightly increased between 2010 and 2020, while the\\nproportion of Buddhi sts and Taoists slightly decreased;\\nHinduism and other faiths remained largely stable in their\\nshare of the popul ation.[409]\\nSingapore hosts monasteries and Dharma centres from all three major traditions of Buddhi sm: Theravada, Mahayana,\\nand Vajrayana. Most Buddhi sts in Singapore are Chinese and adhere to the Mahayana tradition,[410] owing to\\ndecades of missionary activity from China. However, Thailand\\'s Theravada Buddhi sm has seen growing popul arity\\namong the popul ace (not only the Chinese) during the past decade. Soka Gakkai International, a Japanese Buddhi st\\norganisation, is practised by many people in Singapore, and mostly by those of Chinese descent. Tibetan Buddhi sm\\nhas also made slow inroads into the country in recent years.[411]\\nSingapore has four official langua ges: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil.[412]\\nEnglish is the lingua  franca[413][414][415][416] and the main\\nlangua ge used in business, gove rnment, law and\\neducation.[417][418] The Constitution of Singapore and all\\ngove rnment legislation is written in English, and interpreters\\nare required if a langua ge other than English is used in the\\nSingaporean courts.[419][420] Statutory corporations\\nconduc t their businesses in English, while any official\\ndocuments written in a non-English official langua ge such\\nas Malay, Mandarin, or Tamil are typically translated into\\nEnglish to be accepted for use.[421][414][422]\\nMalay was designated as a national langua ge by the Singaporean gove rnment after independence from Britain in the\\n1960s  to avoid friction with Singapore\\'s Malay-speaking neighbour s of Malaysia and Indone sia.[172] It has a\\nsymbolic, rather than functional purpose.[412][423][424] It is used in the national anthem Majulah Singapur a,[425] in\\ncitations of Singaporean orders and decorations and in military commands.[426][427] Singaporean Malay is officially\\nwritten in the Latin-based Rumi script, though some Singaporean Malays also learn the Arabic-based Jawi script.[428]\\nJawi is considered an ethnic script for use on S ingaporean identity cards.[429]Religion\\nLanguagesNational University of Singapore is\\none of six autonomous universities in\\nthe city-state.Singaporeans are mostly bilingua l, typically with English as their common langua ge and their mother-tongue  as a\\nsecond langua ge taught in schools, in order to preserve each individual\\'s ethnic identity and values. According to the\\n2020 census, English was the langua ge most spoke n at home, used by 48.3%  of the popul ation; Mandarin was next,\\nspoke n at home by 29.9% .[427][430] Nearly half a million speak other ancestral Southern varieties of Chinese, mainly\\nHokkien, Teochew, and Cantonese, as their home langua ge, although the use of these is declining in favour of\\nMandarin or just English.[431] Singapore Chinese characters are written using simplified Chinese characters.[432]\\nSingaporean English is largely based on British English, owing to the country\\'s status as a former crown\\ncolony.[433][434] However, forms of English spoke n in Singapore range from Standard Singapore English to a\\ncolloquial form know n as Singlish, which is discouraged by the gove rnment as it claims it to be a substandard\\nEnglish creole that handicaps Singaporeans, presenting an obstacle to learning standard English and rendering the\\nspeaker incomprehensible to everyone  except to another Singlish speaker.[435] Standard Singapore English is fully\\nunde rstandable to all Standard English speakers, while most English-speaking people do not unde rstand Singlish.\\nNevertheless, Singaporeans have a strong sense of identity and conne ction to Singlish, whereby the existence of\\nSinglish is recognised as a distinctive cultural marker for many Singaporeans.[436] As such, in recent times, the\\ngove rnment has tolerated the diglossia of both Singlish and Standard English (only for those who are fluent in both),\\nwhilst continuous ly reinforcing the importance of Standard English amongs t those who speak only Singlish (which is\\nnot mutually intelligible with the Standard English of other English-speaking countries).[436]\\nEducation for primary, seconda ry, and tertiary levels is mostly suppor ted by\\nthe state. All institutions, public and private, must be registered with the\\nMinistry of Education (MOE).[437] English is the langua ge of instruction in\\nall public schools,[438] and all subjects are taught and examined in English\\nexcept for the \"mother tongue \" langua ge paper.[439] While the term \"mother\\ntongue \" in general refers to the first langua ge internationally, in Singapore\\'s\\neducation system, it is used to refer to the second langua ge, as English is the\\nfirst langua ge.[440][441] Students who have been abroad for a while, or who\\nstruggle with their \"Mother Tongue \" language, are allowed to take a simpler\\nsyllabus or drop the subject.[442][443]\\nEducation takes place in three stages: primary, seconda ry, and pre-university\\neducation, with the primary education being compulsory. Students begin with\\nsix years of primary school, which is made up of a four-year founda tion\\ncourse and a two-year orientation stage. The curriculum is focused on the\\ndevelopment of English, the mother tongue , mathematics, and\\nscience.[444][445] Secondary school lasts from four to five years, and is\\ndivided between Express, Normal (Academic), and Normal (Technical)\\nstreams in each school, depending on a student\\'s ability level.[446] The basic\\ncoursework breakdow n is the same as in the primary level, although classes are much more specialised.[447] Pre-\\nuniversity education takes place at either the 21 Junior Colleges or the Millennia Institute, over a period of two and\\nthree years respectively.[448] As alternatives to pre-university education, however, courses are offered in other post-\\nseconda ry education institutions, including the 5 polytechnics and 3 ITE colleges. Singapore has six public\\nuniversities,[449] of which the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University are among\\nthe top 20 uni versities in the world.[450]\\nNational examinations are standardised across all schools, with a test taken after each stage. After the first six years of\\neducation, students take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE),[444] which determines their placement at\\nseconda ry school. At the end of the seconda ry stage, O-Level or N-Level exams are taken;[451] at the end of theEducationNational University Hospital is the\\nsecond largest hospital in the city,\\nserving one million patients yearly.following pre-university stage, the GCE A-Level exams are taken.[452] Some schools have a degree of freedom in\\ntheir curriculum and are know n as autonom ous schools, for seconda ry education level and above .[446]\\nSingapore is also an education hub, with more than 80,000 international students in 2006.[453] 5,000 Malaysian\\nstudents cross the Johor–Singapore Causeway daily to attend schools in Singapore.[454] In 2009, 20% of all students\\nin Singaporean universities were international students—the maximum cap allowed, a majority from ASEAN, China\\nand India.[455]\\nSingapore students have excelled in many of the world education benchmarks in maths, science and reading. In\\n2015, both its primary and seconda ry students rank first in OECD\\'s global school performance rankings across 76\\ncountries—de scribed as the most comprehensive map of education standards.[456][457] In 2016, Singapore students\\ntoppe d both the Program International Student Assessment (PISA)[458][459][460][461] and the Trends in International\\nMathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).[462][463][464] In the 2016 EF English Proficiency Index taken in 72\\ncountries, Singapore placed 6th and ha s been the only Asian country in the top ten.[465][466][467][468]\\nSingapore has a generally efficient healthcare system, even though health\\nexpenditures are relatively low for developed countries.[469] The World\\nHealth Organisation ranks Singapore\\'s healthcare system as 6th overall in the\\nworld in its World Health Report.[470] Singapore has had the lowest infant\\nmortality rates in the world for the past two decades.[471] In 2019,\\nSingaporeans had the longe st life expectancy of any country at 84.8 years.\\nWomen can expect to live an average of 87.6 years with 75.8 years in good\\nhealth. The averages are lower for men.[472] Singapore is ranked 1st on the\\nGlobal Food S ecurity Index.[473]\\nAs of December 2011 and January 2013, 8,800 foreigners and 5,400\\nSingaporeans were respectively diagnos ed with HIV,[474] but there are fewer\\nthan 10 annua l deaths from HIV per 100,000 people. Adult obesity is below 10%.[475] There is a high level of\\nimmunisation.[476] In 2013, the Econom ist Intelligence Unit ranked Singapore as having the best quality of life in\\nAsia and sixth ove rall in the world.[477]\\nThe gove rnment\\'s healthcare system is based upon the \"3M\" framework. This has three compone nts: Medifund,\\nwhich provides a safety net for those not able to otherwise afford healthcare; Medisave, a compulsory national\\nmedical savings account system covering about 85% of the popul ation; and Medishield, a gove rnment-funde d health\\ninsurance program. Public hospitals in Singapore have a considerable autonom y in their management decisions, and\\nnotionally compete for patients, but remain in gove rnment ownership.[478] A subsidy scheme exists for those on low\\nincome.[479] In 2008, 32% of healthcare was funde d by the gove rnment. Healthcare accounts for approximately\\n3.5%  of Singapore\\'s GDP.[480]\\nDespite its small size, Singapore has a diversity of langua ges, religions, and cultures.[481] Former prime ministers of\\nSingapore, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, have stated that Singapore does not fit the traditional description of\\na nation, calling it a society-in-transition, pointing out the fact that Singaporeans do not all speak the same langua ge,\\nshare the same religion, or have the same customs.[481][482] Singaporeans who speak English as their native\\nlangua ge would likely lean toward Western culture (along with either Christian culture or secularism),[483] while\\nthose who speak Chinese as their native langua ge mostly lean toward Chinese culture, which has linkages with\\nChinese folk religion, Buddhi sm, Taoism and Confucianism. Malay-speaking Singaporeans mostly lean towardHealthcare\\nCultureOrnate details on top of Sri\\nMariamman Temple in\\nChinatown district,\\nSingapore\\'s oldest Hindu\\ntemple since 1827.\\nThe National Gallery Singapore\\noversees the world\\'s largest public\\ncollection of Singaporean and\\nSoutheast Asian art.Malay culture, which itself is closely linked to Islamic culture.[484][485] Tamil-\\nspeaking Singaporeans mostly lean toward Tamil culture, which itself is mostly\\nlinked to Hindu culture. Racial and religious harmony is regarded as a crucial part of\\nSingapore\\'s success, and pl ayed a part in bui lding a Singaporean identity.[486][487]\\nWhen Singapore became independent from the United Kingdom  in 1963, most\\nSingaporean citizens were transient migrant labourers who had no intention of\\nstaying permanently.[488] There was also a sizeable minority of middle-class, locally\\nborn people—know n as Peranakans or Baba-Nyonya -descendants of 15th- and 16th-\\ncentury Chinese immigrants. With the exception of the Peranakans who pledged their\\nloyalties to Singapore, most of the labourers\\' loyalties lay with their respective\\nhomelands of Malaya, China and India. After independence, the gove rnment began a\\ndeliberate process of crafting a uniquely Singaporean identity and culture.[488]\\nSingapore has a reputation as a nanny state.[489][490] The gove rnment also places a\\nheavy emphasis on meritocracy, where one is judge d based on one \\'s ability.[491]\\nThe national flower of Singapore is the hybrid orchid, Vanda \\'Miss Joaquim\\', named\\nin memory of a Singapore-born Armenian woman, who crossbred the flower in her\\ngarden at Tanjong Pagar in 1893.[492] Singapore is know n as the Lion City and many\\nnational symbols such as the coat of arms and the lion head symbol make use of a\\nlion. M ajor religious festivals are public holidays.[493]\\nDuring the 1990s  the National Arts Counc il was created to spearhead the\\ndevelopment of performing arts, along with visual and literary art forms.[494]\\nThe National Gallery Singapore is the nation\\'s flagship museum with some\\n8,000 works from Singaporean and other Southeast Asian artists. The\\nSingapore Art Museum focuses on contemporary art. The Red Dot Design\\nMuseum celebrates exceptional art and design of objects for everyday life,\\nhosting more than 1,000 items from 50 countries. The lotus-shaped\\nArtScience Museum hosts touring exhibitions that combine art with the\\nsciences. Other major museums include the Asian Civilisations Museum, the\\nPeranakan Museum, and The Arts House.[495] The Esplanade is Singapore\\'s\\nlargest performing arts centre. In 2016 alone, it was the site of 5,900 free art\\nand culture events.[496][497]\\nLiterature of Singapore, or \"SingLit\", consists of a collection of literary\\nworks by Singaporeans written chiefly in the country\\'s four official langua ges: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil.\\nSingapore is increasingly regarded as having four sub-literatures instead of one. Many significant works have been\\ntranslated and showcased in publications such as the literary journal Singa, published in the 1980s  and 1990s  with\\neditors including Edwin Thumboo and Koh Buck Song, as well as in multilingua l anthologies such as Rhythms: A\\nSingapor ean Millennial Anthology Of Poetry (2000) , in which the poems were all translated three times each. A\\nnumber of Singaporean writers such as Tan Swie Hian and Kuo Pao Kun have contributed work in more than one\\nlangua ge.[498][499]\\nSingapore has a diverse music culture that ranges from pop and rock, to folk and classical. Western classical music\\nplays a significant role in the cultural life in Singapore, with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) instituted in\\n1979. Other notable western orchestras in Singapore include Singapore National Youth Orchestra[500] and the\\ncommunity-based Braddell Heights Symphony Orchestra.[501] Many orchestras and ensembles are also found in\\nseconda ry schools and junior colleges. Various communities have their own distinct ethnic musical traditions:\\nChinese, Malays, Indians, and Eurasians. With their traditional forms of music and various modern musical styles, theArtsLau Pa Sat hawker centre in the\\nfinancial district.

Some of Singapore\\'s best know n pop\\nsingers include Stefanie Sun, JJ Lin, Liang Wern Fook, Taufik Batisah and Dick Lee, who is famous for composing\\nNational Day theme songs , including Home.[503][504]\\nSingapore\\'s diversity of cuisine is touted as a reason to visit the country, due\\nto its combination of conve nience, variety, quality, and price.[505] Local food\\nitems generally relate to a particular ethnicity – Chinese, Malay and Indian;\\nbut the diversity of cuisine has increased further by the hybridisation of\\ndifferent styles (e.g., the Peranakan cuisine, a mix of Chinese and Malay\\ncuisine). In hawker centres, cultural diffusion is exemplified by traditionally\\nMalay hawker stalls also selling Tamil food. Hainanese chicken rice, based\\non the Hainanese dish Wenchang chicken, is considered Singapore\\'s national\\ndish.[506][507]\\nThe city-state has a burgeoning food scene ranging from hawker centres\\n(open-air), food courts (air-conditioned), coffee shops (open-air with up to a\\ndozen hawker stalls), cafes, fast food, simple kitchens, casual, celebrity and high-end restaurants.[508] Cloud kitchens\\nand food delivery are also on the rise, with 70% of residents ordering from delivery apps at least once a\\nmonth.[509][510] Many international celebrity chef restaurants are located within the integrated resorts.[511] Religious\\ndietary strictures exist (Muslims do not eat pork and Hindus do not eat beef), and there is also a significant group of\\nvegetarians. The Singapore Food F estival which celebrates Singapore\\'s cuisine is held annua lly in July.[512]\\nPrior to the 1980s , street food was sold mainly by immigrants from China, India, and Malaysia to other immigrants\\nseeking a familiar taste. In Singapore, street food has long been associated with hawker centres with communal\\nseating areas. Typically, these centres have a few dozen to hundr eds of food stalls, with each specialising in one or\\nmore related dishes.[513][508] While street food can be found in many countries, the variety and reach of centralised\\nhawker centres that serve heritage street food in Singapore is unique.[514] In 2018, there were 114 hawker centres\\nspread across the city centre and heartland hous ing estates. They are maintained by the National Environment\\nAgency, which also grades each food stall for hygiene. The largest hawker centre is located on the second floor of\\nChinatown Complex, and contains over 200 stalls.[514] The complex is also home to the cheapest Michelin-starred\\nmeal in the world – a plate of soya-sauce chicken rice or nood les for S$2 (US$1.50) . Two street food stalls in the city\\nare the first in the world to be awarded a Michelin star, obtaining a single star each.[515]\\nThe development of private sports and recreation clubs began in the 19th century colonial Singapore, with clubs\\nfounde d during this time including the Cricket Club, the Singapore Recreation Club, the Singapore Swimming Club,\\nand the Hollandse Club.[517] Weightlifter Tan Howe Liang was Singapore\\'s first Olympic medalist, winning a silver\\nat the 1960 R ome Games.[518]\\nIndoor  and water sports are some of the most popul ar sports in Singapore. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Joseph\\nSchooling won Singapore\\'s first Olympic gold medal, claiming the 100-metre butterfly in a new Olympic record time\\nof 50.39 seconds .[516] Singapore sailors have had success on the international stage, with their Optimist team being\\nconsidered among the best in the world.[519][520] Despite its size, the country has dominated swim meets in the\\nSoutheast Asia Games. Its men\\'s water polo team won the SEA Games gold medal for the 27th time in 2017,\\ncontinuing Singapore sport\\'s longe st winning streak.[521] Singapore hosted the inaugural 2010 Summer Youth\\nOlympics, in which 3,600 athletes from 204 nations competed in 26 sports.[522] The island is home to ONE\\nChampionship, the biggest Mixed Martial Arts promotion in Asia.[523] Singapore\\'s women\\'s table tennis team wereCuisine\\nSport and recreationJoseph Schooling is a gold\\nmedalist and Olympic record\\nholder at the Rio 2016\\nGames – 100 m\\nbutterfly.[516]\\nThe Ministry of Communications and\\nInformation oversees the\\ndevelopment of infocomm, media\\nand the arts.silver medalists at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.[524][525] They became world\\nchampions in 2010 when they beat China at the World Team Table Tennis\\nChampionships in Russia, breaking China\\'s 19-year winning streak.[526] In 2021,\\nSingapore\\'s Loh Kean Yew achieved a \"World Champion\" status when he won a\\nbadminton gold at the 2021 BWF World Championships men\\'s singles, which is one\\nof the most prestigious badminton tournaments alongside the Summer Olympics\\nbadminton tournaments.[527]\\nSingapore\\'s football league, the Singapore Premier League, was launched in 1996 as\\nthe S.League and comprises eight clubs, including one foreign team.[528][529] The\\nSingapore Slingers is one of the inaugural teams in the ASEAN Basketball League,\\nwhich was founde d in October 2009.[530] Kranji Racecourse is run by the Singapore\\nTurf Club and hosts several meetings per week, including international races—\\nnotably the Singapore Airlines International Cup.[531]\\nSingapore began hosting a round of the Formula One World Championship, the\\nSingapore Grand Prix at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in 2008.
